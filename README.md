| [ms](https://github.com/zeit/ms) | 2019-11-13 | <p>Utility to convert human readable time declarations to milliseconds and vice-versa </p> ✅ Light weight <br /> ✅ No dependencies |
| [braces](https://www.npmjs.com/package/braces) | 2019-11-13 | Utility to expand expression like `{01..05}`. You rarely need it, but whenever you do, consider using this package vs doing it manually by hand. |
| [micromatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromatch) | 2019-11-13 | Library to perform glob matching against a file path. There are many other alternatives like `minimatch`, `nanomatch`, 'multimatch' and so on. I prefer this one, since it's pretty fast (as per the benchmarks) and has fewer dependencies. Go for [picomatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picomatch) if you don't need brace expansion. |
